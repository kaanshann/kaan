# World Happines Report Project
**In this project, answers were sought for three questions based on the happiness rates of countries according to many criteria:  
1-Which countries or regions rank highest in overall happiness and each of the six factors that contribute to happiness?  
2-How did the country rankings or scores change between 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 reports?  
3- Has any country experienced a significant increase or decrease in happiness?**

## Which countries or regions rank highest in overall happiness and each of the six factors that contribute to happiness? 

For the answer to this question, first of all, the 10 countries with the highest happiness score in each year and the happiness score of these countries were drawn.

The answer to the second question was reached from these graphs.Between 2015-2016, the first-tenth countries in general have not changed. There was no new country entry or exit to the list. Likewise, between the years 2016-2017, the names of the country have not changed. Then, for the evaluation of six factors, the country's name and value, which has the highest value of the desired factor each year, was withdrawn from the data set and bar graph was prepared.

For the answer to the third question, the inquiry was made with if-else. The countries with the highest and lowest happiness score of each year were listed and the names of the top 20 and the last 20 were compared between two years. If the country, which was in the last 20 in the previous year, entered the first twenty in the following year, it would be considered to have experienced a significant increase. But no country could provide this condition.  
Likewise, similar procedure was applied for a significant decrease. When a country in the top 20 entered the last 20, a significant decline was accepted. But again no country has provided this condition.
